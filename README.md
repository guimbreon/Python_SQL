# Python Projects with SQL/mySQL

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that use SQL or mySQL for data storage and management.

## Projects

- **Project 1:** A web scraping tool that retrieves data from a website and stores it in a mySQL database. The script is designed to run periodically to keep the database up-to-date.

- **Project 2:** A command-line interface (CLI) program that allows users to add, remove, and update records in a mySQL database. The program uses Python's built-in SQLite module to interact with the database.

- **Project 3:** An e-commerce platform that uses a mySQL database to store product information, order history, and user data. The platform is built using Flask and allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete the checkout process.

## Getting Started
